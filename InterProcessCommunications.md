# Articles discussing various inter-process communication (IPC) methods, their performance and resilience aspects:

## General overviews:

"Inter-Process Communication in Distributed Systems" by Martin Kleppmann: This comprehensive article provides a detailed explanation of different IPC mechanisms, including pipes, sockets, shared memory, message queues, and RPCs. It covers performance considerations like latency and throughput, as well as resilience aspects like fault tolerance and scalability. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/
"A Comparison of Inter-Process Communication Approaches" by The New Stack: This article compares popular IPC methods like shared memory, message queues, and sockets in terms of performance, complexity, and reliability. It also discusses factors like security and synchronization. https://api.riot-os.org/group__core__msg.html
Specific methods and their considerations:

"Shared Memory for High Performance IPC" by Real Time Engineers: This article delves into shared memory IPC, highlighting its advantages like speed and efficiency. It also discusses potential drawbacks like synchronization challenges and data corruption risks. https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/library/ipc-through-shared-memory
"Messaging Queues for Reliable Asynchronous IPC" by O'Reilly Radar: This article focuses on message queuing systems like RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka, emphasizing their asynchronous nature and ability to buffer messages for reliable delivery. It also talks about scalability and fault tolerance benefits. https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-message-brokers/9781492049296/
"REST APIs for Distributed Communication" by DZone: This article explains RESTful APIs as an IPC method, highlighting their standardized interfaces and ease of integration across diverse platforms. It covers security considerations and potential performance limitations. https://dzone.com/articles/rest-api-tutorials
Performance and resilience comparisons:

"A Performance Comparison of Messaging Systems" by Red Hat: This article compares popular messaging systems like ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization. It provides helpful insights for choosing the right system for specific performance needs. https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09895
"Building Microservices: Choosing the Right IPC for Resilience" by InfoQ: This article discusses the importance of resilience in microservices architectures and compares different IPC options like service meshes and API gateways in terms of fault tolerance and disaster recovery capabilities. https://medium.com/@nelsonekpenyong/before-you-consider-microservices-a92b5e66774b


Remember, the best IPC method depends on your specific needs and context. Consider factors like performance requirements, message size, desired level of reliability, and system complexity when making your choice.
